                aulad..nahi matlb man gaye bhai aapko...jainwin 🙏. Apka letter
                mila muje...pehle toh ye batto kis gum se chipkya tha bc...khul
                hi nahi raha tha😾. Khair koi nahi...Ha toh sunne mai aarha aap
                miss wiss kr rahe muje....karun guddi laal??....khair mazak se
                hatke I miss you tooooooo 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭(7 times cry kr
                dia...Thala for a reason). Kya bolu yar...sahi bata it was hard
                for me to digest that we were no more talking at that time. The
                good days we spent and the good vibe we shared...honestly saying
                I have never thought of such kind of thing will happen to us in
                my wildest dream.I dont even know how to write this to you.<br />
                <br />
                You were some of those guys i would never ditch on...like never
                but I dont know things were maybe right or maybe wrong at that
                time or before...its all kind of mess for me now...and i dont
                know how to recollect all this mess which I have created. You
                were someone for me whom I can trust more than anyone in this
                fucking entire college 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭(fir se 7 times cry kr
                dia...)

              <h2></h2>
              <p>
                And yes talking about the memories...bhai I cant forget them..
                each and every single incident is printed in my mind. I cant
                forget any of those at any point of my life. From you standing
                outside my Applied Numerical's class to me coming online after
                you spammed hundreds of roheees in my dm and then telling me
                that your laptops mouse is not working aur mai aapko solution
                bata raha hun tabhi I see this text 👉"Bhai aap muje gali toh
                nahi doge na". 😾😾😾😾 (That video is still with me jisme tu
                aapne touchpad ko pitt rahi hai....."chal jaa bkl")
                <br /><br />
                I'll never forget how cutely you went to that run button of vs
                code and then pressed it...and then saying...bhai ye html ka
                code run nahi ho raha...(PS: thats why I thought to make
                this)<br />
                <br />
                And fir bhai aapna Experential...sahi mai what a blast it was!!
                You believe me or not you will always be that first photo of my
                new phone. Obviously you were the last also. From you coming out
                of trail room and showing me how you looked in every dress to me
                judging you..."ha mast lagg raha tere pe....lele". And me
                obviously never tired of clicking your photos. I hope you
                remebered that day when we ate 250 rupees ice cream and then
                spending our whole fucking money on eating expensive shit.
                <br />
                <br />
                Honestly saying...I have never experienced all this before in my
                entire life. I have never thought we would enjoy this much
                together. You are the best partner to go malls with. I have also
                missed all these.
                <br />
                <br />
                And of course that sauce stain in your shoes.

            <div class="slide">
              <p>
                At this point I dont know who was wrong who was right I dont
                want to go back to that shit...and I dont care anymore. But I
                too still miss you sometimes(yess sometimes...kunki jyada miss
                krne lagg gya to idhar placement mai chud jaunga). Again I dont
                how to write this to you and make you believe that I truly care
                for you. But if you can please try to give me another chance so
                I can again make you smile by pookie reels. 😽

                Like actually kis muh se tuje bolu ki "yarr ekk bar milte hai".
                All that decision which took at time was very spontenous and I
                dont how to deal that at that time. I know I am very immature
                (pr hoon toh aaka pookie na). And yes "wo khete hai na mard ne
                hamesa aapni pasandida aurat ko khoya hai....mere liye ki kehte
                hai...infact maine hi likha hai". Mere liye toh infact ye bhi
                kehte hai "jagg ne cheena mujse...muje jo bhi laga
                pyara"😭😭😭😭😭😭😭(fir se 7 times cry aagya...)
                <br />
                <br />
                Pr at the end I can only say you sorry for being a dick(lawda)
                and yes ekk bar milte hai (obv if you are open to it). Baaki toh
                bas itna hi kehna hai you are the fucking best. 😻
